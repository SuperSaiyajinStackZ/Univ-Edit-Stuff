# Univ-Edit-Stuff
Universal-Edit-Hex and Universal-Edit related stuff from me. :P

You will be able to find the following things in the future:

- [x] The Sims 2 GBA and NDS Scripts and Labels for Universal-Edit-Hex.

You can find Universal-Edit-Hex [here](https://github.com/Universal-Team/Universal-Edit-Hex). (This version is used for save editing related stuff for this repository).

You can find Universal-Edit [here](https://github.com/Universal-Team/Universal-Edit). (This version is used for some text editing related stuff for this repository).

## UniStore

Yes, you can also download all of the stuff from Universal-Updater with the `stack-univ-edit` UniStore. The UniStore can be found in the `unistore` folder.

Alternatively, you can just scan the following QR Code on Universal-Updater under `Settings Tab` -> `Select UniStore` -> `PLUS icon on the bottom right` -> `QR Code icon on the bottom left`.
