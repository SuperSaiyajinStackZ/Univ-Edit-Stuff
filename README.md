# Univ-Edit-Stuff
Universal-Edit-Hex and Universal-Edit related stuff from me. :P

You will be able to find the following things in the future:

- [x] The Sims 2 GBA and NDS Scripts and Labels for Universal-Edit-Hex.
- [x] Animal Crossing Wild World Scripts and Labels for Universal-Edit-Hex.
- [x] Some other stuff, not sure yet.

Those will be stored in separate folders, those would be the following:
* Sims 2: `/Sims2/` (The base directory for The Sims 2 GBA and NDS).
* Sims 2 GBA: `/Sims2/GBA/` (From Checksum-Updater up to some editing tools for The Sims 2 GBA).
* Sims 2 NDS: `/Sims2/NDS/` (From Checksum-Updater up to some editing tools for The Sims 2 NDS).
* Sims 2 GBA and NDS: `/Sims2/Common/` (Some shared things related for The Sims 2 GBA and NDS).
* Animal Crossing: Wild World: `/ACWW/` (The base directory for Animal Crossing Wild World).

You can find Universal-Edit-Hex [here](https://github.com/Universal-Team/Universal-Edit-Hex). (This version is used for save editing related stuff for this repository).

You can find Universal-Edit [here](https://github.com/Universal-Team/Universal-Edit). (This version is used for some text editing related stuff for this repository).
