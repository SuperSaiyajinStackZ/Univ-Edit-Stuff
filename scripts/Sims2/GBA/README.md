# The Sims 2 GBA Tools

## CastEditor
A small The Sims 2 GBA Cast Save Editor Tool. NOTE: You need the `Cast.json` from the `Strings` folder for this tool to work inside `sdmc:/3ds/Universal-Edit-Hex/Scripts/Sims2/GBA/Strings/` for Nintendo 3DS, or `sd:/_nds/Universal-Edit-Hex/Scripts/Sims2/GBA/Strings/` for Nintendo DS(i). If the folders don't exist, create it, but ehh i shouldn't have to mention that as it is obvious lol.
